This is a short document describing some details of gitg related to packaging
it for distributions. This is not in any way a guide or instructions for
packagers to follow. Rather, it describes some of the layout and installed
files of gitg which can be useful for packagers.

= Components =
gitg is written as a set of core libraries, plugins and the main application.
The following sections briefly describe each component. Note that the lists
of provided files might not be entirely recent, so please do not take them
as authoritive.

== libgitg (unstable) ==
libgitg is a reusable shared library containing several utility classes and
widgets that can be reused by other applications. The library can be packaged
separately and used independently of other gitg components.
gobject-introspection and vapi files are also available for this library.

Relevant installed files are:

Library:
- ${libdir}/libgitg-1.0.so.0
- ${libdir}/libgitg-1.0.so.0.0.0
- ${libdir}/girepository-1.0/Gitg-1.0.typelib

Development:
- ${datadir}/gir-1.0/Gitg-1.0.gir
- ${datadir}/vala/vapi/libgitg-1.0.vapi
- ${libdir}/libgitg-1.0.so
- ${libdir}/libgitg-1.0.la
- ${libdir}/pkgconfig/libgitg-1.0.pc
- ${prefix}/include/libgitg-1.0/libgitg/libgitg.h


== libgitg-ext (unstable) ==
libgitg-ext is a shared library containing extension interfaces to be
implemented by extensions of the main gitg application. Extensions can link
against this library and implement (for example) GitgExtActivity to provide
a new, dynamically loaded, activity for gitg.

Revelant installed files are:

Library:
- ${libdir}/libgitg-ext-1.0.so.0
- ${libdir}/libgitg-ext-1.0.so.0.0.0
- ${libdir}/girepository-1.0/GitgExt-1.0.typelib
- ${python_libdir}/site-packages/gi/overrides/GitgExt.py

Development:
- ${datadir}/gir-1.0/GitgExt-1.0.gir
- ${datadir}/vala/vapi/libgitg-ext-1.0.vapi
- ${libdir}/libgitg-ext-1.0.so
- ${libdir}/libgitg-ext-1.0.la
- ${libdir}/pkgconfig/libgitg-ext-1.0.pc
- ${prefix}/include/libgitg-ext-1.0/libgitg-ext/libgitg-ext.h


== Plugins ==
gitg currently implements two functionalities itself as plugins, using
libgitg-ext. The plugins are installed as shared libraries which are loaded
at runtime. Since these plugins are considered core functionality, they should
be installed with the gitg application and not as a separate package.

Installed:
- ${libdir}/gitg/plugins/libfiles.so
- ${libdir}/gitg/plugins/files.plugin
- ${libdir}/gitg/plugins/libdiff.so
- ${libdir}/gitg/plugins/diff.plugin


== gitg ==
The main gitg application is installed as a standard binary, a man page,
several icons, metainfo, a desktop file, gsettings schema and locale translations.

Installed:
- ${bindir}/gitg
- ${datadir}/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.gitg.gschema.xml
- ${datadir}/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.gitg-symbolic.svg
- ${datadir}/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.gitg.svg
- ${datadir}/gitg/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/diff-symbolic.svg
- ${datadir}/metainfo/org.gnome.gitg.metainfo.xml
- ${datadir}/applications/org.gnome.gitg.desktop
- ${datadir}/man/man1/gitg.1
- ${datadir}/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/gitg.mo



= Dependencies =
Following is a list of dependencies of gitg. Note that these are subject to
change and a definite list can be obtained by inspecting configure.ac instead:

- glib >= 2.68
- gtk+ >= 3.10
- gtksourceview >= 3.10
- gobject-introspection >= 0.10.1
- webkit2 >= 2.2
- libgit2-glib >= 0.0.10
  - libgit2 is a dependency of libgit2-glib. Please make sure that libgit2
    is compiled with threading support (-DTHREADSAFE:BOOL=ON). gitg will refuse
    to configure if libgit2 is not available with threading support
- gee-0.8
- json-glib >= 0.16
- gsettings-desktop-schemas
- libpeas >= 1.5.0
- libpeas-gtk >= 1.5.0
- gspell-1 >= 1.8.1

gitg has a soft dependency on python due to its plugin system. Building gitg
without python is perfectly possible, and since there are currently no plugins
implemented in python, it will not affect core functionality. However, we would
like to be able to have third party developers write plugins in python and it
is therefore recommended to have python as a dependency for gitg.
