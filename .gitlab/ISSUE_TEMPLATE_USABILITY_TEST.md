<!-- Make sure to check on the [Contribution Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to design and run tests and to report results. -->

# Objective
The test goals. e.g.: Evaluate the features to add a remote repository and fix merge conflicts.

# Requirements

## Environment
What is the environment that should be tested and how it should be prepared. e.g.: The test needs to run in GNOME 3.32 version and a repository needs to be cloned.

## User profile
Describe the target users you are looking for the test. e.g.: A user that has already used other projects similar to Gitg, like GitKraken.

## Facilitator
What the facilitator should be familiar with to run the tests. e.g.: The facilitator needs to know how to use git.

# Test design
## Tasks
A list of tasks that the user has to perform. e.g.:

* Add a remote repository.
* Fix merge conflicts.

## Scenarios
A list of scenarios for the user to perform the tasks. They should put the user in a context and not give specific hints about what you want the user to do. e.g.:

1. You have finished your work and want to commit to your forked repository, but you only have the origin repository in your machine. Please, add your remote and push your changes to it.
2. You were about to open your Merge Request to the repository, but you had merge conflicts when you were updating your branch with master branch. Can you fix the conflicts?

### Task 1

#### What went well?
Users intuitively clicked on the "?" icon to find the help documentation.

#### What were the challenges?
Some users didn't understand how to create a new blog post inside a folder, they first created the post and then edited the folder to include the post inside of it. They said they were looking for a select input to choose where the blog post should be placed instead of a folder icon.
